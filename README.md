# Toeholder-microRNAs-for-CRC
I used Toeholder, NUPACK and BLAST+ to design molecular sensors called "toehold switches" that can bind to and detect the presence of colorectal cancer microRNAs. This project was conducted at the Research Science Institute (RSI) 2022 under Dr Elizabeth Wood and Dr Matt Cain, JURA Bio.
